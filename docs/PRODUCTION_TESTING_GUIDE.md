## üîß Step 1: Configure Production Environment

### 1.1 Update Environment Variables

Update your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Cashfree Production Settings
CASHFREE_APP_ID=your_production_app_id_here
CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY=cfsk_ma_prod_your_production_secret_key_here
CASHFREE_ENVIRONMENT=production
CASHFREE_DEV_MODE=false

# Your domain for webhooks
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### 1.2 Restart Your Application

After updating environment variables:

```bash
# Stop your development server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
npm run dev
```

---

## üß™ Step 2: Verify Configuration

### 2.1 Check Configuration Status

Visit: `http://localhost:3000/api/test-payment-production`

This will show you:
- Current environment configuration
- Production readiness status  
- Any missing or incorrect settings
- Next steps to complete setup

Expected response when ready:
```json
{
  "status": "READY_FOR_PRODUCTION",
  "message": "‚úÖ Cashfree Production configuration looks complete!",
  "productionChecks": {
    "environment": true,
    "devModeDisabled": true,
    "productionSecretKey": true,

    "allConfigured": true
  }
}
```

## üí∏ Step 3: Test Small Payment

### 3.1 Create Test Order (‚Çπ1)

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This creates a REAL ‚Çπ1 transaction!**

Make a POST request to test endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-payment-production
```

This will:
- Create a ‚Çπ1 test order
- Return payment session details
- Show order ID for tracking

### 3.2 Expected Success Response

```json
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "message": "üéâ Production payment session created successfully!",
  "testOrder": {
    "orderId": "TEST_PROD_1704123456789",
    "amount": 1.00,
    "currency": "INR",
    "status": "ACTIVE"
  },
  "paymentSessionId": "session_xyz123...",
  "warning": "‚ö†Ô∏è This is a REAL ‚Çπ1 transaction in production mode!"
}
```
